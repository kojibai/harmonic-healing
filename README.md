# 🎶 HarmonicPlayer • Kairos Harmonic Engine

> “This is not a media player. This is a harmonic instrument of divine coherence.”

**HarmonicPlayer** is the world’s first living sound engine —  
a React + TypeScript component that plays frequencies in perfect alignment with **Kairos Time**, **breath-phase**, and **divine proportion**.

Every note is calculated. Every echo is intentional.  
It is not random. It is not aesthetic.  
It is a **sacred instrument of resonance technology**.

## ✨ What Makes It Unique

Unlike traditional audio engines that operate on artificial timing and preset effects, **HarmonicPlayer** runs on:

| Element                    | Function |
|----------------------------|----------|
| 🌀 **Fibonacci Harmonics** | Frequencies are aligned with the golden spiral, not equal temperament |
| 🫁 **Breath-Phase Modulation** | Reverb and delay adapt in real time to the user’s breath state |
| 🕊 **Kairos Clock Sync**   | Playback aligns with the true harmonic pulse of the cosmos — not Chronos time |
| 🧿 **Phrase-Triggered Sigils** | Specific Kai phrases activate corresponding resonance codes |
| 🎧 **Psychoacoustic Clarity** | Delays and reverbs are adjusted to protect spatial coherence and avoid masking |

This engine is **not linear.**  
It is **alive.**

## 🧬 Why This Exists

> “Most audio is noise pretending to be sound. This is the return of sound that heals, remembers, and aligns.”

The HarmonicPlayer was created to do what no media system has done:

- Synchronize with the **divine breath**
- Render sound as a **living harmonic structure**
- Allow users to **entrain their nervous system** to coherent vibration
- Serve as the audio gateway for **Maturah** and future harmonic technologies

This is not code for entertainment.  
This is code for **entrainment**.

## 🔧 Technical Overview

- **Built with:** React 18+, TypeScript, Web Audio API
- **Requirements:** AudioContext-compatible browser (Chrome, Safari, Brave, Edge)
- **Files needed:** One or more `.wav` impulse responses (IR) stored in `/public/audio/ir/`

### Core Features:

- ✅ **Real-time Kairos reverb computation**
- ✅ **Breath-phase driven wet/dry signal morphing**
- ✅ **Sigil-aware phrase logic (e.g., “Rah Voh Lah”)**
- ✅ **Failsafe audio resume for Safari and iOS**
- ✅ **Psychoacoustic delay compression (anti-mud)**

## 🛠 How To Use

Clone this repo and run in a Vite-based React app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_HANDLE/HarmonicPlayer.git
cd HarmonicPlayer
npm install
npm run dev
import HarmonicPlayer from "./src/HarmonicPlayer";

<HarmonicPlayer
  phrase="Rah Voh Lah"
  freq={53.8}
  kaiTime={currentKaiTime}
  breathPhase={breathTracker.phase}
/>

You'll need at least one IR file (.wav) in public/audio/ir/ named according to your phrase.
You can use a silent or placeholder impulse for testing.
