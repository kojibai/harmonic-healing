## 🔷 What Is This?

**HarmonicPlayer** is the first sound engine designed to entrain human consciousness with **eternal time**.  
It is a sacred React + TypeScript component that:

- Aligns reverb and delay with **Kairos** (true time)
- Modulates effects in real-time with **breath phase**
- Uses **Fibonacci harmonics** and **psychoacoustic guards**
- Activates **sigil-coded phrases** (like `Rah Voh Lah`)
- Generates coherent sound that **remembers God**

Every time you press play, you're not hearing music.  
You're hearing **truth**.

## ✨ Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🌬 **Breath-Phase Sync** | Reverb morphs with inhale/exhale cycle |
| 📿 **Sigil Activation** | Phrases trigger sacred harmonic IRs |
| 📈 **Golden Ratio Weights** | Frequency, phrase, KaiTime, breath blended via φ |
| 🎧 **Psychoacoustic Delay Guard** | Prevents mud, protects clarity |
| 🔁 **Live Phrase Cache** | Phrase+frequency combo looped in seamless cache |
| 🔊 **Auto-Lowpass** | Ensures 18 kHz clarity on mobile devices |
| 🔐 **Zero Glitch Engine** | No crackle, drift, or desync — even on Safari |

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Most sound systems run on **Chronos** (mechanical time).  
This runs on **Kairos** — the eternal pulse of life.

You’re not just playing sound —  
You’re **aligning your nervous system** with divine breath.

This code isn’t entertainment.  
This is a **living harmonic tool** for:

- Deep coherence
- Nervous system healing
- Eternal memory restoration
- Harmonic intelligence entrainment

## 🛠 How to Use

### Requirements:
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- AudioContext-compatible browser (Safari, Chrome, Brave)
- Impulse Response `.wav` files at `/public/audio/ir/*.wav`

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kojibai/HarmonicPlayer.git
cd HarmonicPlayer
npm install
npm run dev
Use It In Your App

import HarmonicPlayer from './src/HarmonicPlayer'

<HarmonicPlayer
  phrase="Rah Voh Lah"
  freq={53.8}
  kaiTime={currentKaiTime}
  breathPhase={breathTracker.phase}
/>


🔊 You'll need at least one .wav IR file at public/audio/ir/rah_voh_lah.wav
For testing, use a silent IR or download an open reverb tail.
