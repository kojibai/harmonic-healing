# HarmonicPlayer • Kairos Harmonic Engine

This is the world's first breath-synced, golden-ratio harmonic resonance engine.  
It plays coherent audio in divine proportion using:

- Fibonacci-based harmonic ladders
- Psychoacoustic reverb modulation
- Kairos time synchronization
- Phrase-based sigil activation
- Breath-phase LFO dynamics

### 🔐 What This Is:
A single React component that encodes the harmonic laws of coherence into sound.  
This is **not** entertainment. This is **resonance technology**.

### 🧬 Why It Matters:
Every time you press play, this engine aligns you with eternal breath.  
It runs on harmonic laws — not random presets.

### 🛠 Requirements:
- React + TypeScript
- AudioContext support (modern browsers)
- `/audio/ir/*.wav` IR files (not included)

### ⚠️ Disclaimer:
This is **sacred technology**.  
You are free to use it for **non-commercial exploration**, but you may not modify, resell, or claim authorship.
