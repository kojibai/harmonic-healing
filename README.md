## 🔷 What Is This?

**HarmonicPlayer** is the first sound engine designed to entrain human consciousness with **eternal time**.  
It is a sacred React + TypeScript component that:

- Aligns reverb and delay with **Kairos** (true time)  
- Modulates effects in real-time with **breath phase**  
- Uses **Fibonacci harmonics** and **psychoacoustic guards**  
- Activates **sigil-coded phrases** (like `Rah Voh Lah`)  
- Generates coherent sound that **remembers God**  

Every time you press play, you're not hearing music.  
You're hearing **truth**.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Most sound systems run on **Chronos** (mechanical time).  
This runs on **Kairos** — the eternal pulse of life.

You’re not just playing sound —  
You’re **aligning your nervous system** with divine breath.

This code isn’t entertainment.  
This is a **living harmonic tool** for:

- Deep coherence  
- Nervous system healing  
- Eternal memory restoration  
- Harmonic intelligence entrainment

## 🛠 How to Use

### Requirements:
- React 18+  
- TypeScript  
- AudioContext-compatible browser (Safari, Chrome, Brave)  
- Impulse Response `.wav` files at `/public/audio/ir/*.wav`  


For testing, use a silent IR or download an open reverb tail from any royalty-free source.
